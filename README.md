# EDA-Predicting-the-Survival-of-Titanic-Passengers.
The main aim of this project is to predicting the surveillance of Titanic ship passanges. Before going to prediction of the project, first I made Exploratory Data Analysis, here I was cleaning all the data and made a table in such a way that it is usefull while analysing the data. I used numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib library to analyse the data and by using some supervised learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Decision Tree algorithm, Random forest, K-Neighbors Classifier. Finally I got the result as more females are survied than the male.
